I'm an entering 3rd year undergraduate student at the University of Hull, studying Computer Science. For my final year project, I'm working on 3D Object Representation and Learning using KANs (Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks), under the supervision of [Dr. Qingde Li](https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/Qingde-Li), focusing on the research and development of a functional prototype.

**Research interest** 
------
My research interest lies at intersection of Computer Vision and graphics, I'm especially interested in but not limited to:

- Machine learning
  - Neural network architectures/learning methods for 3D object understanding
- Computer vision
- Computer graphics

**Ongoing Projects**
------
KANs Network Development and Analysis (Honours Stage Project)
Exploring Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) for 3D object reconstruction and topological feature modeling.
Conducting experiments with 3D datasets using Python and PyTorch to analyze performance and accuracy.
Designing frameworks to enhance feature extraction with learnable activation functions.
Benchmarking KANs against traditional machine learning models for scalability and precision.
ResearchMap
Developing an open-source visualization tool to map research collaborations effectively.
Implementing APIs with Python and Flask to retrieve and display researcher data dynamically.
Creating interactive network visualizations using modern web technologies for data representation.
Collaborating on frontend and backend development to ensure seamless user experiences.

**Open Source**
------
I'm interesting in collaboration and contributing to interesting open source project, particularly game engines and AI:

*Coming Soon*

**Personal Interests**
------
*Technology and Innovation*

In my spare time, I do some game development and I'm also interested in game engines and how AI can be integrated into them. I also enjoy reading and learning about anything related to computer vision or graphics.

Some older games I have made before:

*Sports*

I also play basketball; I've been on the University of Hull basketball club for about three years.

*Hobbies*

I like learning about other cultures, particularly Chinese, and am potentially interested in learning Mandarin.
