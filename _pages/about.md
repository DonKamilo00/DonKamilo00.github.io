I'm an entering 3rd year undergraduate student at the University of Hull, studying Computer Science. For my final year project, I'm working on 3D Object Representation and Learning using KANs (Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks), under the supervision of [Dr. Qingde Li](https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/Qingde-Li), focusing on the research and development of a functional prototype.

**Research interest** 
------
My research interest lies at intersection of Computer Vision and graphics, I'm especiially interested in but not limited to:

- Machine learning
  - Neural network architectures/learning methods for 3D object understanding
- Computer vision
- Computer graphics

**Ongoing Projects**
------
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section


**Open Source**
------
I'm interesting in collaboration and contributing to interesting open source project, particularly game engines and AI:

*Coming Soon*

**Personal Interests**
------
*Technology and Innovation*

In my spare time, I do some game development and I'm also interested in game engines and how AI can be integrated into them. I also enjoy reading and learning about anything related to computer vision or graphics.

Some older games I have made before:

*Sports*

I also play basketball; I've been on the University of Hull basketball club for about three years.

*Hobbies*

I like learning about other cultures, particularly Chinese, and am potentially interested in learning Mandarin.
