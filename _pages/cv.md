### KANs Network Development and Analysis
University of Hull
**Dates:** Summer 2024 – Present  

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Investigating the potential of KANs in capturing the complex topological features of 3D geometric objects, aiming to understand how KANs can be adapted to recognize and classify intricate shapes and structures.
  - Conducting a comprehensive analysis of the performance of KANs in comparison to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) when applied to 3D object datasets, focusing on accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability.
  - Designing a novel framework that integrates KANs with existing 3D geometric learning algorithms, ensuring that the learnable activation functions of KANs are effectively utilized to enhance feature extraction from 3D data.
  - Developing an advanced prototype model using KANs that can accurately predict and generate 3D geometric shapes, leveraging the unique spline-based structure of KANs for improved precision and detail in shape representation.
  - Investigating the interpretability of KANs in the context of 3D geometric learning, exploring how the learnable activation functions on the edges can provide insights into the learning process and outcomes.
  - Conducting research on existing KAN frameworks and their applications in various fields.
  - Collaborating with cross-functional teams to integrate the KANs network with other tools and platforms.
