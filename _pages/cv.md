### KANs Network Development and Analysis

**Dates:** Summer 2024 â€“ Present  

- **Objective:** Initiating the development and analysis of Knowledge and Network Systems (KANs) to enhance collaborative learning and information sharing within [specific domain/industry].
  
  The main objectives of this project are:
  1. **Investigate the potential of KANs** in capturing the complex topological features of 3D geometric objects, aiming to understand how KANs can be adapted to recognize and classify intricate shapes and structures.
  2. **Conduct a comprehensive analysis** of the performance of KANs in comparison to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) when applied to 3D object datasets, focusing on accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability.
  3. **Design a novel framework** that integrates KANs with existing 3D geometric learning algorithms, ensuring that the learnable activation functions of KANs are effectively utilized to enhance feature extraction from 3D data.
  4. **Develop an advanced prototype model** using KANs that can accurately predict and generate 3D geometric shapes, leveraging the unique spline-based structure of KANs for improved precision and detail in shape representation.
  5. **Investigate the interpretability of KANs** in the context of 3D geometric learning, exploring how the learnable activation functions on the edges can provide insights into the learning process and outcomes.

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Conducting research on existing KAN frameworks and their applications in various fields.
  - Designing a tailored KAN model to meet the needs of [specific user group or organization].
  - Developing a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction and data exchange.
  - Facilitating workshops and training sessions to introduce the KANs network to stakeholders.
  - Collecting and analyzing feedback for system improvement.
  - Collaborating with cross-functional teams to integrate the KANs network with other tools and platforms.

- **Technologies Used:** Python

- **Current Progress:**
  - literature review and drafting/design.
